Problem: MBP is in the clear















Solution: Randomize MBP into RBP using [Kil88]























Problem: Partial evaluation attacks



Solution: Bookends and High dimensional random matrices



Problem: Input mixing attacks



Solution: bundling scalars and a dummy branch



Problem: attacks against the multilinear structure



Solution: use better MMAP implementations



final result: iO for NC1



Bootstrap to iO for all P
